/*First Example*/

//Create a variable where you extend the view

  //Tell the view where your element should be rendered

  //This creates a template for how our output will be shown
  template: _.template("<p>Hello my name is <%= who %></p>"),
  //Create an initialization function telling the server to render your inputs

  //Create the render function telling where the content will be put
  //To access the template use this.template, don't forget to specfiy who
  //you are 

//initialize the view by creating a new view

/*Second Example*/

//Create a shared name for everything to reference

//create a model with defaults of a generic first and last name

//Create a new view this time telling the view to render in the other
//given div and format what is shown to be exactly the same as above
//Hint to get the first and last names of the model use this.model

//Create a new model for yourself with your first and last name

//Create a new view with the model passed into it
